Hey now!

- O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;[^fn1]
- The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
- The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
- While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; 
- {:.indent-3}But O heart! heart! heart!
- {:.indent-4}O the bleeding drops of red,
- {:.indent-5}Where on the deck my Captain lies,
- {:.indent-6}Fallen cold and dead.

- O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; 
- Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle[^fn2] trills,
- For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
- For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
- {:.indent-3}Here Captain! dear father!
- {:.indent-4}This arm beneath your head!
- {:.indent-5}It is some dream that on the deck,
- {:.indent-6}You’ve fallen cold and dead.


- My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,[^fn3]
- My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
- The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
- From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
- {:.indent-3}Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
- {:.indent-4}But I with mournful tread,
- {:.indent-5}Walk the deck my Captain lies,
- {:.indent-6}Fallen cold and dead.
